# Todo App

Todo App created using HTML, CSS, JavaScrcript and different programming patterns.
Such patterns include the Module pattern and Classes/Factory Functions to structure the data that would be passed from the forms and rendered to the screen.

Webpack, ESlint, Prettier, and other dependencies where you used for bundling, linting, and ensuring the app was built with consistency.

## Process

A todo app is a staple for any beginner developer, this was built with it's soul focus to utilize the module pattern, classes and factory functions at it's core for easy to understand data structure (Todos, Projects, and the ProjectList).

Integration with localStorage was made easy by having a good foundation within each module. In most cases it was as easy as creating a `load()` and `save()` method on the `ProjectList` class.

## Hosting

Hosting was done through Github Pages. Icons we're provided from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and inspiration for the design came from [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/).
