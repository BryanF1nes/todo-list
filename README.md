# Todo App

A fully-featured Todo application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on clean architecture and modern programming patterns. This project incorporates the Module Pattern, Classes, and Factory Functions to create a clear, maintainable structure for managing application state and user interactions.

Bundling and tooling were handled using Webpack, with ESLint, Prettier, and other development dependencies ensuring code consistency and reliability throughout the project.

## Process

The Todo App is a classic project for beginners and intermediate developers alike. The primary goal for this implementation was to deepen familiarity with architectural patterns—most notably the module pattern and class-based structures.

Core entities such as Todos, Projects, and the overarching ProjectList were designed with data clarity and ease of manipulation in mind. This structure made integration with localStorage straightforward; in most cases, implementing load() and save() methods inside the ProjectList class was sufficient to persist and retrieve application state.

## Hosting

The application is hosted using GitHub Pages.

Icons are provided via [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Design inspiration was taken from [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/), with a minimal and approachable user interface.
